Now, when I learnt the fact the only question arose in my mind was - how, in the hell, can I even start to quantify such a statement? I can imagine this might be the exact problem that Einstein faced. Soon, I learned that the non-flatness of the spacetime can be represented by a metric tensor. And learnt that, in GR, in spherically symmetric static case the metric turns out to be Schwarzschild metric. But I couldn't figure out how to work out the trajectories. So the purpose of this article is to explain exactly this, that is how to calculate the trajectories in a given metric." ,"id":2},
