Particles have mass and a well-defined position whereas waves are carriers of energy and are delocalized. Two waves on meeting don't bounce off like particles instead, these interfere with each other. However, these distinctions seem to break down as we peek into the world at quantum scale. It has been observed that light and matter has properties of both particles and waves but both these properties cannot be observed simultaneously. This is known as the complementarity principle. In this article, we will try to understand the various experiments done by scientists to observe this dual nature of light simultaneously and the shocking results they got." ,"id":4}

So, are there any cool modifications to Euclid's proof as well?" ,"id":1}
