String theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. It is regarded as a complex  field of physics that only a select few understand.  We hit this myth out of the park in this project where we understood the nature of String Theory starting from scratch."},

We use these tools to develop the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation to simplify the problems which would be a menace if we were to solve them using just Newton's equations! We used these formulations to obtain an elegant solution to the Heavy Symmetric Top."},
