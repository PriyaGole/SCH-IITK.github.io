Sanders, Grant Sanderson(3B1B), James Schloss and Benoit Forget. This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking. We use the Julia programming language to approach real-world problems in varied areas applying data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling. In this class you will learn computer science, software, algorithms, applications, and mathematics as an integrated whole. Topics include: Image analysis, Particle dynamics and ray tracing, Epidemic propagation, Climate modeling."

String theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. It is regarded as a complex  field of physics that only a select few understand.  We hit this myth out of the park in this project where we understood the nature of String Theory starting from scratch."

We use these tools to develop the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation to simplify the problems which would be a menace if we were to solve them using just Newton's equations! We used these formulations to obtain an elegant solution to the Heavy Symmetric Top."
